### Experience

#### Cloud Engineer at Virgin Australia April 2018 - present

- Establishment of best infrastructure as a code practices for AWS.
- End to end design and implementation of Kubernetes + Istio setup on top of AWS.
- Establishment of best CI/CD and DevSecOps patterns and practices for microservices.

#### Senior Systems Engineer at Atlassian March 2017 - March 2018

- Full stack design and implementation of microservices in AWS.
- Support and development of existing Tier 0 multi region, highly redundant services:
  - Atlassian DNS.
  - Atlassian Smart Edge proxies.
  - Atlassian MAIL/Messaging services.

**Achievements:**

- Designed and implemented a very scalable(from 500 to > 50 Million r/month), secure and a very cost efficient serverless solution, which added more visibility for mail transactions and helped to detect SPAM/other mail issues.
- Introduced new and enhanced existing dev/ops patterns used in a Team.

#### Senior DevOps Specialist at NBN Co Limited  April 2014 - March 2017

- Operated under Agile, DevOps and CI/CD practices.
- Was leading the security-related stream of work.
- Solutions architecture.
- Infrastructure as a code.
- Full stack automation in AWS.
- Zero downtime deployments.
- Migration of on premise applications into AWS.
- Establishment of coding/security/operational patterns.
- Responsible for on premise enterprise platforms automation (Mostly IBM and Oracle products).

**Achievements:**

- Designed and implemented on premise zero downtime deployment solution.
- Couched new team members to become DevOps gurus.
- Successfully led a shift from Puppet to Ansible and Ruby to GoLang.
- Implemented two factor authorization for Mcollective + ActiveMQ cluster.
- Designed and implemented an automatic penetration testing framework(based on ZAP) to test internal & external NBN's applications.  
- Rolled out Ansible based solutions at NBN.
- Migrated **all** non TLS/SSL protected endpoints to HTTPS endpoints.
- Fully automated a complex IBM's Maximo platform.

#### Developer Operations at NBN Co Limited - July 2012 - March 2014 (1 year 9 months)

- End to end environments automation.
- Worked very close with software delivery teams.
- Software build, packaging and deployment automation.
- Support for DevOps tools like Puppet Enterprise stack, Ansible, Mercurial & Git servers, CI/CD servers and orchestration tools.
- Design and implementation for supplementary DevOps applications like Mcollective apps & agents, Ansible roles, Puppet modules.


**Achievements:**

#### Senior Engineer at Kcell JSC - July 2010 - May 2012 (1 year 11 months)


- As a domain expert was involved in a critical Billing
Platform migration project.
- Was responsible for the design and implementation of automation tools for
the regression tests procedure, system monitoring and different types of data reconciliation.
- Analysed
complex database table structures to design SQL scripts and PL/SQL procedures.
- ETL design and
performance tuning (execution plans).

**Achievements:**

- Designed, developed and implemented an automated traffic verification tool, detection gaps between online-
charged traffic and CDR-based (from network equipment). This tool allowed finding configuration/hardware
problems with such GSM platforms like SMSC, GGSN, MSC, BGW. Revenue loss decreased and average
traffic difference became less than 0.1%.
- Developed a reconciliation tool between HLR and billing platform
(on daily basis) that helped matching opened/closed services on HLR and Billing System. Difference in two
databases decreased from 500 000 entries (first run) to 0 - 300 per day.
- Was responsible for the design and
development and complete automation of the data importer for the payments reconciliation tool. - Cut down
source system difference and DWH data from 1.2% to 0%.

#### Engineer at Kcell JSC - 2006 - August 2010 (3 years 10 months)

- Extensively worked in UNIX (up to SUN E25K) and in Oracle (OLTP and OLAP) environments.
- Resolved systems problems by debugging, identifying the main cause and applying corrective maintenance.

eliminating of any kinds of revenue leakages.

**Achievements:**

- Designed a mapping architecture of services
Page2between prepaid and postpaid systems. More than 95% of total services (VAS, P2P, GPRS, USSD) had
been matched. This helped reporting team to prepare better quality reports and allowed to create a traffic
reconciliation between online-traffic and CDR-based traffic.
- Designed, developed and implemented a
monitoring tool, which allowed tracking 90% of faults with the Prepaid system.

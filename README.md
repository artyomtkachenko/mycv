  - Atlassian DNS.
  - Atlassian Smart Edge proxies.
  - Atlassian MAIL/Messaging services.

**Achievements:**

- Designed and implemented a very scalable(from 500 to > 50 Million r/month) and cost efficient serverless solution, which added more visibility for mail transactions and helped to detect SPAM/other mail issues.
- Introduced new and enhanced existing dev/ops patterns used in a Team.

#### Senior DevOps Specialist at NBN Co Limited  April 2014 - March 2017

- Full stack automation in AWS.
- Cloud Dev/Ops.

- Establishment of coding/project/operational patterns.
- Responsible for on premise enterprise platforms automation (Mostly IBM and Oracle products).
- Leading the security-related aspects of DevOps.
- Continues Improvements, Innovation and Security.

**Achievements:**

- Designed and implemented on premise Zero Downtime deployment solution.
- Couched new team members to become DevOps gurus.
- Successfully led a shift from Puppet to Ansible and Ruby to GoLang.
- Implemented two factor authorisation for Mcollective + ActiveMQ cluster.
- Designed and implemented an automatic penetration testing framework to test internal & external NBN's applications.  
- Rolled out Ansible based solutions at NBN.
- Migrated **all** non TLS/SSL protected endpoints to HTTPS endpoints.
- Fully automated a complex IBM's Maximo platform.

#### Developer Operations at NBN Co Limited - July 2012 - March 2014 (1 year 9 months)

#### Senior Engineer at Kcell JSC - July 2010 - May 2012 (1 year 11 months)


- As a domain expert was involved in a critical Billing
Platform migration project.
- Was responsible for the design and implementation of automation tools for
the regression tests procedure, system monitoring and different types of data reconciliation.
- Analysed
complex database table structures to design SQL scripts and PL/SQL procedures.
- ETL design and
performance tuning (execution plans).

**Achievements:**

- Designed, developed and implemented an automated traffic verification tool, detection gaps between online-
charged traffic and CDR-based (from network equipment). This tool allowed finding configuration/hardware
problems with such GSM platforms like SMSC, GGSN, MSC, BGW. Revenue loss decreased and average
traffic difference became less than 0.1%.
- Developed a reconciliation tool between HLR and billing platform
(on daily basis) that helped matching opened/closed services on HLR and Billing System. Difference in two
databases decreased from 500 000 entries (first run) to 0 - 300 per day.
- Was responsible for the design and
development and complete automation of the data importer for the payments reconciliation tool. - Cut down
source system difference and DWH data from 1.2% to 0%.

Page2between prepaid and postpaid systems. More than 95% of total services (VAS, P2P, GPRS, USSD) had
been matched. This helped reporting team to prepare better quality reports and allowed to create a traffic
reconciliation between online-traffic and CDR-based traffic.
- Designed, developed and implemented a
monitoring tool, which allowed tracking 90% of faults with the Prepaid system.
